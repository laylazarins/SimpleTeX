# SimpleTeX

At the start of every semester, UBC's Center for Accessibility sends out emails to students of certain classes,  offering Notetaker jobs to help support students that have a disability and can't easily take notes themselves.

SimpleTeX is a work-in-progress online text editor made using React, utilizing Firebase as a database, with rich text and LaTeX support.
